      <description>Multivariate linear regression Linear regression with multiple variables is also known as &amp;ldquo;multivariate linear regression&amp;rdquo;.
Notation Hypothesis Gradient descent Formula:
Partial derivation will be like this:
Feature scaling If scale of features differ widely, it may take long time to converge. So it is necessary to scale the feature.
The contour will look like a circle after scaling.
Problem: Is converge result which is scaled the same as converge result which is not scaled.</description>

      <description>Supervised learning Predict output according to the correct dataset which are already known.
Supervised learning problems are categorized into &amp;ldquo;regression&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;classification&amp;rdquo; problems
House price prediction This is a regression problem, whose prediction value is continuous.
Do regression according to history data, you can do linear regression or quadratic regression which is up to you.
Then do prediction using this result.
Breast cancer This is a classification problem, whose prediction value is discrete.</description>
